# Collaborative-Filtering
Assignment for CSC2506 Class. First I derived the distribution and mean and variance equations for Bayesian Regression. Then I derived the conjugate prior for a univariate Gaussian. Then I built an Email Spam Classifier using 3 different types of Logistic Regression. Finally I used Collaborative Filtering to model the MovieLens-100k dataset.
