The statement MUST BE TRUE. We show that $x_4$ is d-seperated from $x_5$ conditioned on $x_3 \\Rightarrow x_4 \\perp x_5 \\mid x_1, x_2, x_3$. This is clear though since there are only 2 paths, so we just have to check them both. $x_4 \\rightarrow x_6 \\rightarrow x_5$ doesn't work since $x_6$ explains away $x_4$ and $x_5$. $x_4 \\rightarrow x_3 \\rightarrow x_5$ doesn't work either since $x_3$ is the common cause of $x_4$ and $x_5$.\n\n2. The statement MUST BE TRUE. Once again we show that $x_3$ is d-seperated from $x_7$ conditioned on $x_4$ and $x_5$. There are only two paths to check, $x_3 \\rightarrow x_4 \\rightarrow x_6 \\rightarrow x_7$ and $x_3 \\rightarrow x_5 \\rightarrow x_6 \\rightarrow x_7$. $x_4$ and $x_5$ block each path respectively as they are being conditioned on and they form chains between $x_3$ and $x_6$.\n\n3. The statement MUST BE TRUE. There is only 1 path $x_1 \\rightarrow x_3 \\rightarrow x_2$ which is blocked since $x_3$ and all of its is descendants are not conditioned on, meaning it explains away $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n\n4. The statement COULD BE TRUE. We can only determine that $x_4$ and $x_5$ are not d-connected, but this is not sufficient to conclude that they are not independant. To show that $x_4$ and $x_5$ are not d-connected, take the path $x_4 \\rightarrow x_6 \\rightarrow x_5$.\n\n##Undirected Graph\n\n1. The statement CANNOT BE TRUE. It is enough to find a path from $x_4$ to $x_5$ that doesn't pass through $x_1$, $x_2$ or $x_3$. One such path is $x_4 \\rightarrow x_7 \\rightarrow x_5$.\n\n2. The statement MUST BE TRUE. Every path between $x_3$ and $x_7$ passes through either $x_4$ or $x_5$.\n\n3. The statement CANNOT BE TRUE. $x_1$ and $x_2$ share an edge and so cannot be independant!\n\n4. The statement CANNOT BE TRUE. A path that goes from $x_4$ to $x_5$ without passing $x_3$ or $x_6$ is $x_4 \\rightarrow x_7 \\rightarrow x_5$\n\n\\newpage\n\n#Complete graphs\n\n1. Consider the following 5 variables ordered arbitrarily as $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, and $x_5$. We wish to draw a directed graphical model which can capture any joint distribution and is acyclic.\nThis means that we want our graph to capture the following dependancy:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) &= p(x_1)P(x_2 \\mid x_1)p(x_3 \\mid x_2, x_1)p(x_4 \\mid x_3, x_2, x_1)p(x_5 \\mid x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1) \n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom this we see we must capture all the pairwise dependancies: \n$P(x_i \\mid x_j) \\quad \\forall i > j \\in \\left\\{ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\\right\\}$\n\nWe see that the following graph models this dependancy, given our ordering. \n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle,thick,draw}]\n    \\node (A) at (6,2.5) {$x_1$};\n    \\node (B) at (2,0) {$x_2$};\n    \\node (C) at (10,0) {$x_3$};\n    \\node (D) at (4,-4) {$x_4$};\n    \\node (E) at (8,-4) {$x_5$};\n\\end{scope}\n\n\\begin{scope}[>={Stealth[black]},\n              every node/.style={fill=white,circle},\n              every edge/.style={draw=black,very thick}]\n    \\path [->] (A) edge node {$p(x_2 \\mid x_1)$} (B);\n    \\path [->] (A) edge node {$p(x_3 \\mid x_1)$} (C);\n    \\path [->] (A) edge node {$$} (D);\n    \\path [->] (A) edge node {$$} (E);\n    \n    \\path [->] (B) edge node {$$} (C);\n    \\path [->] (B) edge node {$p(x_4 \\mid x_2)$} (D);\n    \\path [->] (B) edge node {$$} (E);\n    \n    \\path [->] (C) edge node {$$} (D);\n    \\path [->] (C) edge node {$p(x_5 \\mid x_3)$} (E);\n    \n    \\path [->] (D) edge node {$p(x_5 \\mid x_4)$} (E);\n    \n\\end{scope}\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\n2. We see that no edges Can be added to this graph since it is complete (every pair of nodes is connected by an edge). If any edge is removed from this graph we see that we will be enforcing certain conditional independancies which would limit the class of distributions that this graph can convey. This is since it would only be able to model joint distributions with particular conditional independancies between the variables.\n\n3. We seek to draw an undirected graphical model on four variables which can capture any joint distribution. We also want to list all the maximal cliques. Again we see that we need edges between every pair of vertices or else we will not be able to capture every possible joint distribution (since missing edges imply that we can only model joint distributions with conditional independances). We see the following graph satisfies this since it is complete. Note that this graph is complete meaning that it has exactly one maximal clique - the entire graph itself.\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=3cm, every loop/.style={},\n                    thick,main node/.style={circle,draw,font=\\sffamily\\Large\\bfseries}]\n\n  \\node[main node] (1) {$x_1$};\n  \\node[main node] (2) [below left of=1] {$x_2$};\n  \\node[main node] (3) [below right of=2] {$x_3$};\n  \\node[main node] (4) [below right of=1] {$x_4$};\n\n  \\path[every node/.style={font=\\sffamily\\small}]\n    (1) edge node [left] {} (4)\n        edge node [left] {} (3)\n        edge node [left] {} (2)\n        \n    (2) edge node [right] {} (1)\n        edge node {} (4)\n        \n    (3) edge node [right] {} (2)\n    \n    (4) edge node [left] {} (3);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n4. Once again, no edges can be added since the graph is complete, and none can be removed or else the graph will not be able to model every possible joint distribution, and only ones with particular conditional independances between the variables.\n\n5. [Bonus]  The claim is TRUE. We prove it by showing that every graphical model which can capture any joint distribution must be complete and that a complete graph has $\\frac{k^2}{2} - \\frac{k}{2}$ edges.\n\n- Firstly, if a graphical model is not complete than it will be missing edges $\\Rightarrow$ it can only model joint distributions with conditional independancies imposed between some of it's variables. So clearly the graph must be complete.\n\n- Secondly, a complete graph has edges between every possible pair of nodes. This means if the graph has k nodes it has ${k \\choose 2}$ edges. Note that ${k \\choose 2} = \\frac{k!}{(k-2)!2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} - \\frac{k}{2}$. So the claim holds, as needed.\n\n#Learning Undirected Models\n\nWe are given the following \n\n$$p(x \\mid \\theta) = exp \\biggl\\{\\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s} + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} \\theta_{st}x_{s}x_{t}-\\Phi(\\theta) \\biggl\\}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\theta) = log \\biggl\\{\\sum_{x} exp \\biggl\\{\\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s} + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} \\theta_{st}x_{s}x_{t} \\biggl\\} \\biggl\\}\n$$\n\n\n##MLE for Fully Disconnected pairwise binary MRF\n\nNote that the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the node parameters $\\theta_s$ when E = $\\emptyset$ is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\ell(\\theta \\mid x) = ln p(x \\mid \\theta) = ln \\biggl\\{ exp \\biggl\\{\\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s} -\\Phi(\\theta) \\biggl\\} \\biggl\\} = \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s} - \\Phi(\\theta)\n$$\n\nSo for data points $x_s^{(i)}$, $i = 1, 2,$ ...$N$, each with features $s = 1, 2,$...$, k$.\n\n$$  \\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\theta_s \\mid x)}{\\partial \\theta_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ln P(x_s^{(i)} \\mid \\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s}  \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s}^{(i)} - \\Phi(\\theta) = 0$$\n\nand using the linearity of the differentiation operator and that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s} \\Phi(\\theta) = E(x_s \\mid \\theta)$ since $x$ is in the exponential family we have that, after rearranging terms:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x_s} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{s}^{(i)} = E(x_s \\mid \\theta)\n$$\n\nFinally a plot of the $\\theta_s$ for each senator can be found in figure 1.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=250pt]{fig1.jpg}\n\\caption{Plot of each Senators theta parameter, assuming a fully disconnected graph}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo compute the expectation we see that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nE(x_s \\mid \\theta) &= \\sum_{x_s=0}^{1} \\frac{exp( \\sum_{i=1}^{13} x_i \\theta_i) x_s}{\\sum_{x_s=0}^{1} exp(\\sum_{i=1}^{13} x_i \\theta_i)} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x_s=0}^{1} \\frac{\\prod_{j \\ne s} exp( x_j \\theta_j) exp( x_s \\theta_s) x_s}{\\sum_{x_s=0}^{1} \\prod_{j \\ne s} exp(x_i \\theta_i) exp(x_s \\theta_s)}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{x_s=0}^{1} x_s \\frac{e^{x_s \\theta_s}}{1+e^{x_s \\theta_s}}  \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{\\theta_s}}{1+e^{\\theta_s}}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\nAnd combining this yields:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x_s} = \\frac{e^{\\theta_s}}{1+e^{\\theta_s}} \\Rightarrow \\theta_s = ln(  \\frac{\\bar{x_s}}{1 - \\bar{x_s}} )\n$$\n\n##Gradient of the Log Likelihood of This Model\n\nFirst we find the sufficient statistics. Using that $x^{(i)}$ is from the exponential family, we see that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP(Data) &= \\prod^{N}_{i=1} P(x^{(i)}) = \\prod^{N}_{i=1} exp \\biggl\\{\\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s}^{(i)} - \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E}  \\theta_{st} x_{s}^{(i)} x_{t}^{(i)}  - \\Phi(\\theta) \\biggl\\} \\\\\n&= exp \\biggl\\{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s}^{(i)} - \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E}  \\theta_{st} x_{s}^{(i)} x_{t}^{(i)}  - N \\Phi(\\theta) \\biggl\\} \\\\\n&= exp \\biggl\\{ \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)} - \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E}  \\theta_{st} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)} x_{t}^{(i)}  - N \\Phi(\\theta) \\biggl\\}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the sufficient statistics are $\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)} x_{t}^{(i)}$\n\nNow, given this we derive an expression for the gradient of this log-likelihood with respect to $\\theta_s$ and $\\theta_{st}$\n\nFor $\\theta_s$ we have that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\theta_s \\mid x)}{\\partial \\theta_s} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s}^{(i)} + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} \\theta_{st}x_{s}^{(i)}x_{t}^{(i)}-\\Phi(\\theta) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)} - N E(X_s \\mid \\theta) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)} - N P(X_s = 1 \\mid \\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $x_s \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n\nFor $\\theta_{st}$ we have that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\theta_{st} \\mid x)}{\\partial \\theta_{st}} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{st}} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{s \\in V}  \\theta_{s}x_{s}^{(i)} + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} \\theta_{st}x_{s}^{(i)}x_{t}^{(i)}-\\Phi(\\theta) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)}x_{t}^{(i)} - N E(X_s X_t \\mid \\theta) \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^N x_{s}^{(i)}x_{t}^{(i)} - N P(X_s = 1 \\cap X_t = 1 \\mid \\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n\n##Computing ML Estimates of Model Parameters\n\nUsing the above gradient objective formulas and the MATLAB optimization package $\\texttt{L1General}$, we computed the ML estimates of a fully connected pairwise graphical model. We used this on the full Senate voting record. Figure 2 contains a plot the log-likelihood of the model after each iteration.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=250pt]{fig2.jpg}\n\\caption{Plot negative log-likelihood of fully connected model}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n##Representational Power of this Model\nThe fully connected, pairwise graphical model estimated cannot represent any\njoint distribution on N binary variables? This is because it can only capture pairwise dependancies, but not higher order ones. An example of one such higher order dependancy is as follows: suppose Senator Paul always voted with Senator Franken, provided Senator Reid did too. Our pairwise model would be unable to capture this three-way interaction.\n\n##Binary Entropy Comparison\nWe compared the factorized model and the fully connected model by computing the binary entropy of each of the corresponding joint distributions. We found that the binary entropy was 12.2 and 7.23 respectively. Since the difference is not that large, this suggests that the voting patterns of Senators are largely unaffected by the voting patterns of other Senators.\n\n##Using Factorized Laplacian Priors\nWe explore what happens when we put a Laplacian prior on each $\\theta_s$ and $\\theta_{s,t}$. The prior has the following form:\n\n$$P(\\theta \\mid \\lambda) =  \\prod_{s \\in V}  \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2}e^{(-\\lambda_s \\mid \\theta_s  \\mid)} \\prod_{(s,t) \\in E} \\frac{\\lambda_{st}}{2}e^{(-\\lambda_{st} \\mid \\theta_{st}  \\mid)}$$\n\nWe see that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ell(\\theta \\mid x, \\lambda) &= \\sum_{i=1}^N ln P(x^{(i)} \\mid \\theta, \\lambda) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^N ln P(x^{(i)} \\mid \\theta) + ln P(\\theta \\mid \\lambda) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^N ln P(x^{(i)} \\mid \\theta) + \\sum_{s \\in V}  log \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} \\right) -\\lambda_s \\mid \\theta_s \\mid + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} log \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{st}}{2} \\right) -\\lambda_{st} \\mid \\theta_{st}  \\mid \\\\\n&\\propto \\sum_{i=1}^N ln P(x^{(i)} \\mid \\theta) - \\bar {\\lambda } \\sum_{(s,t) \\in E} \\mid \\theta_{st}  \\mid\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that the last step follows if we impose the contstraints that $\\lambda_s \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\lambda_{st} = \\bar {\\lambda }$.\n\n##Comparing Different Values of Our L1 Penalization Term\n\nFrom the above we saw that, given $\\lambda_s \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\lambda_{st} = \\bar {\\lambda }$, adding the Laplacian prior is equivalent to adding an identical L1 regularization penalty term on each of the $\\lambda_{st}$ terms.\nWe used the votes for the first 400 bills as a training set, and the remaining 86 bills as a validation set to train seperate ising models, varying the value of $\\bar {\\lambda }$. We evaluated the log-probability of the validation data, and plotted this in figure 3.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=400pt]{fig3.jpg}\n\\caption{Plot of negative log-likelihood vs Log Value of Theta Bar Hyperparameter}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\newpage\n\n##Associating Graphical Structures\nWe notice that setting $\\bar{\\lambda}$ = 0.5 gave the model which produced the highest validation log-likelihood, and that $\\bar{\\lambda}$ = 0.1 gave the graph with the smallest number of edges that was nevertheless connected. One way we could associate graphical structures to the models learned is by using the $\\texttt{drawlayout}$ function. This function creates a graph with distances of nodes based on the value of the $\\theta$ parameters between the senators. We plot the aformentioned models in figures 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nIt is interesting to note that upon $\\ell^1$ regularization, edges are maintained disproportionately along party lines. This means that senators tend to vote along party lines, with the noticable exception of Senator Paul. Anyone who follows politics will notice that this isn't surprising, since this is something he is known for.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=200pt]{fig4.jpg}\n\\caption{Graph which produced the highest validation log-likelihood}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=200pt]{fig5.jpg}\n\\caption{Graph with the smallest number of edges that was nevertheless connected}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n",
