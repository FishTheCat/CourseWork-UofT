# Ising-Model
This was the second Assignment in the CSC2506 Class. The goal of the assignment was to better understand undirected models. Specifically we looked at a Binary Markov Random Field called an Ising model. I used this to model the voting records of US Senators the Voting record of the 112th US Congress.

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to evaluate statements about Directed Graphical Models
* How to implement the computation of sufficient statistics and the log-likelihood of an Ising model. The files I made these changes to are _suffStats.m_ and _isingLlik.m_ respectively.

## Software Used
* The report was written in RMarkdown and converted to TeX.
* I used the _tikz_ package from LaTeX to draw the graphs for the report.
* The model was trained using code from Matlab.

## How to Use
* Unzip hw2senate.zip
* run mrf_question.m to get the figures and put them in the figures folder.
* knit hw1-998367342.Rmd in RStudio generate the final report.
* The program will return a tex file and a pdf of the report.
