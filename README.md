# CourseWork

A repo consisting of the coursework I did as a student at UofT. Each course has a corresponding folder, and the correspondance should be clear by the naming. In each of these folders are another set of folders, each containing the seperate projects done for the course. Each of these projects are accompanied by a README file. The README file contains a summary of the project, what I learned, the software used, and how to use the code.

## Course List
