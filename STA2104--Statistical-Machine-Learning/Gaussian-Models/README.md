# Gaussian-Models
We compared a linear model to two Gaussian process models (one with linear covariance and one without) using data from the 1990 US census. Our goal was to analyze the differences in these models. We also analyzed a paper on predicting Aspergerâ€™s syndrome using some of the machine learning techniques learned in the STA2104 course.

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to fit a Gaussian Process Model With and without Linear Covariance from scratch.
* How to optimize hyperparameters using grid search.
* How to critique a [Machine Learning research paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085819).

## Software Used
* This project was done in R. Since every function was written from scratch, no packages were used.

## How to Use
* Run _Assignment 3 Code.R_ to get the results presented in the report.
