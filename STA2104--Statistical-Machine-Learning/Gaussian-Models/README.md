# Gaussian-Models
We compared a linear model to two Gaussian process models (one with linear covariance and one without) using data from the 1990 US census. Our goal was to analyze the differences in these models. We also analyzed a paper on predicting Aspergerâ€™s syndrome using some of the machine learning techniques learned in the STA2104 course.
