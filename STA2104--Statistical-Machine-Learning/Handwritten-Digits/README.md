# Handwritten-Digits
A project for a fourth year course in Machine Learning. We trained a Logistic Regression and Conditional Gaussain Classifier (with and without regularization) on a sample of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to use a Logistic Regression and Conditional Gaussian Classifier.
* How to regularize a covariance matrix for numeric stability.
* How to implement a stopping critereon using net change in L1 distance of weight update.
* How to evaluate performance of different models.

## Software Used
* This project was done in R. Every function was written from scratch, so no packages were used.

## How to Use
* Run _Assignment2Code.R_ to get the results presented in the report.
