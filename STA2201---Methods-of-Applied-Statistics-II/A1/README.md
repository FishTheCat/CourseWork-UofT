STA2201 Coursework. In the first assignment I conducted a simulation study to show that the Likelihood Ratio Statistic was asymptotically Chi Squared, derived some distributions, and analysed the lifetime of some fruit flies. The second assignment involved analysing Math scores and some Cyctic Fibrosis data using a Linear Mixed Model. On the final assignment, I used a Generalised Additive Model to model Carbon levels in Antarctica. Then I analysed moss levels in Galacia using a Generalised Geostatistical Model. Finally I used Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximations to analyse data from the American National Youth Tobacco Survey.
