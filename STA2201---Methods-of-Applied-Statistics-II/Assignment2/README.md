# STA2201 Second Assignment

STA2201 Coursework. In this assignment I did the following:
- Computed the Maximum Likelihood Estimate for the Covariance matrix of a given Linear Mixed Model.
- Fit a random effects model on a dataset of Math Scores using schools as a random effect.
- Fit a random slopes and Serial Correlation Model to analyze the effects of a particular gene on the rate of lung infection for CF patients and presented a report on the findings. I found that, if we used a naive model, the research hypothesis was supported, but this was not the case when using the model with the most reasonable assumptions.
- I analyzed the results of a Linear Geostatistical Model on lead levels of moss in Galacia. I found that humans influence the lead content in the moss, while environmental variables were not significant. 

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to decide between using Fixed and Random effects in a given model.
* How to use random slope models with serial correlation to model temporal correlation.
* How to interpret the results from a Linear Geostatistical model.

## Software Used
* This project was done in R, the report was rendered into LaTeX using RMarkdown.
* I used the following R packages:
	- nlme to fit Random Effects Models.

## How to Use
* Knit ```STA2201 A2.Rmd``` to generate the report.
